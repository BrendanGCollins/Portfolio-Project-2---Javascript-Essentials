- Randomly chosen questions each time
   - I have added an array of 20 questions and shuffle the questions so that each time you start the quiz you get different questions given to you. No question will be repeated twice in the quiz.

- Countdown Timer
  - A 10 second countdown timer starts as soon as you click the start button. If it reaches zero you will get 0 points and it will say 'Time up!'. You will also be shown the correct answer and can review the question before clicking 'next' to continue with the quiz. Radio buttons are disabled if timer reaches zero to prevent a user clicking the correct answer after it has been shown.
  - Timer resets for every question and stops once you finish the last question.
